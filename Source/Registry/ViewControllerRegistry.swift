/// A registry that looks up view controllers for a given <Token>. This token should be a type that is able to uniquely
/// identify any VC, and also provide any data that the VC needs to be constructed.
///
/// The registry works by registering a number of functions. To retrieve a VC, the <Token> is passed into all
/// registered functions along with the <Context>, and the 1st non-nil VC that comes back is used as the return value.
///
/// Note that registrants should make sure they don't "overlap" - if more than 1 registrant could potentially return a
/// VC for the same token, behaviour is undefined - there's no guarantee which will be returned first.
